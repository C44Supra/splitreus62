All these files were created from scratch, but out of respect for Phil I wanted to GPLv3 the project. 

Thanks to Phil for the staggering measurements from the atreus, and profet23 for the 62 key variant. 

This project uses MIT licensed KiCad footprints from Keebio and the Lily58 project.
_Note: this version does not support the low profile case._
### Features: 
- Reversible PCB supports Kailh Hot Swap switch holders.
- Pro Micro Footprint borrowed from the Lily58.
- supports SMD and through hole diodes.
- Breakout pins for led underglow.


### Known issues:
- Silk screen from the footprints are a little weird in this branch
