# Build Guide (WIP)

## Steps
The only order of steps that matter are diodes before switches. Other than that it's pretty much up to you. I prefer the order listed below.

* Note: this build guide uses the low profile case that is compatible with pcb mounted switches. A case is in the works for plate mounted switches. 

#### Diodes


#### Pro Micro


#### Switches
